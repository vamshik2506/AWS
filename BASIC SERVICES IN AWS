Security & Basics:
- IAM: Controls who can do what in your AWS environment. It’s your first stop for setting up users, roles, and permissions.
- CloudTrail: Keeps track of every action taken in your AWS account. Essential for auditing and troubleshooting.
Networking & Routing:
- VPC: Your own private section of AWS’s network where your resources run securely.
- Route53: DNS service that helps direct users to your app, whether it’s in AWS or somewhere else.
Compute & Databases:
- EC2: Lets you configure and run virtual machines in the cloud.
- ECR (Elastic Container Registry) & ECS (Elastic Container Service): Store and run containerized applications at scale without manually managing servers.
- RDS: Manages common databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL) so you don’t have to worry about setup, updates, or backups.
Storage & Data:
- S3: Reliable storage for files, backups, logs, and more. It’s cheap, secure, and integrates with almost everything on AWS.
- DynamoDB: A NoSQL database that’s fully managed and can handle a huge amount of traffic, perfect for serverless applications.
Serverless & Event-Driven:
- Lambda: Run code only when needed, without managing servers. Great for event-driven apps or data processing tasks.
- SQS / SNS / EventBridge: Handle messages and events between services, keeping parts of your application loosely connected.
- Step Functions: Orchestrate multi-step tasks (like a checkout process) across different AWS services in a clear, visual workflow.
APIs & User Management:
- API Gateway: Easily create and manage APIs for your services.
- Cognito: Handles user sign-up, sign-in, and security tokens to avoid coding your own authentication system.
Infrastructure & Observability:
- CloudFormation: Define your entire AWS setup using code, so you can easily recreate or modify environments in a controlled manner.
- AWS Code Services (CodeBuild, CodePipeline, CodeDeploy) for CI/CD: Automate building, testing, and deploying your applications to deliver updates faster.
- CloudWatch: Get metrics, logs, and dashboards to monitor how your application is performing, and set alarms if something goes wrong.
Edge & Security:
- CloudFront: A global content delivery network that speeds up how quickly users can access your static or dynamic content.
- ELB (Elastic Load Balancing): Distributes traffic to multiple servers or containers, making your application more resilient.
